## Citation 1

- Some the use of css property from w3schools
- URL: https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp
- Date accessed: February 06, 2021
- I find w3shools/css is a useful website and all the css property are in order.It is easier to check than lecture videos and zybooks when I am not sure the use of some property.

## Citation 2

I found f-news2 could not float to the right until I set overflow:auto to it. Maybe the article 2 content is too big to fit into the area when to the right. I also found inline-block can reach the same effect of float.

Rashmi Chandy tried to help me for this problem. But I settled down it before we had a meeting.
Anyway, I very much appreciate her help.

Dr. Sampangi helped me also. He reminded me setting a border will add its width to the content width. For example, one article 50% with border 1px will result 100% + 4px for total width of two article. However, it is not working when I remove the border, so it seems not the key.

## Dark Mode

- First, we should set all background color to black and all texts to white.

  Html {

  Backgroud-color: black;

  color: white;

  }

- Then for specific elements: content use deep colors, for example, #0000ff; backgroud use deep colors, for exanple, #000055.
